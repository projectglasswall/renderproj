        <b>Vision</b>
        <p>As America continues to be a country that nurtures entrepreneurship and the labor lifestyle,
             it is critical to find solutions that will allow for lives to be made easier and save time. 
             Time directly translates to the amount of profit that can be made, therefore it is imperative that our product, ARGOS, becomes the industry standard. 
             The current problem is that many businesses, particularly those in warehousing and logistics, face challenges in efficiently tracking and managing inventory.
              Misplaced items, inefficient workflows, and delays in locating products lead to wasted time and financial losses.
              This technology is particularly beneficial for businesses seeking to optimize workflow, minimize losses due to misplaced items, and enhance productivity in fast-paced warehouse environments. 
              By implementing ARGOS, companies can streamline operations, reduce operational costs, and improve overall productivity, ultimately driving greater profitability and customer satisfaction.</p>
        <b>Mission</b>
        <p>ARGOS is a drone-based inventory management solution that utilizes real-time image analysis to detect and track objects within a warehouse environment. The drone scans the area with the provided predetermined path , identifies specific objects, and updates a live database, which is accessible through a web-based interface. This allows warehouse staff, logistics managers, and inventory specialists to monitor inventory in real time with minimal manual effort. By integrating automation and live data visualization, ARGOS enhances workflow efficiency, reduces errors, and optimizes large-scale storage and distribution operations. By leveraging real-time image analysis, ARGOS aims to streamline inventory management by ensuring that items are accurately placed and accounted for. By integrating a drone, warehouse staff can efficiently monitor inventory with minimal manual effort, reducing errors and improving operational efficiency. Our product will be able to scan the desired  environment and keep track of the specified identified objects and their  quantity.</p>
